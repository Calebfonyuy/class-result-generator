# Class result generator

This project generates excel files containing a list of students and marks for two sequences. 

Ensure you create a folder named `output` in the same folder as main.py before executing it. 


To run this file use
````
python main.py -n n -c c -s s
````

Where
* n is the number of students per class
* c is the number of classes to generate
* s is the number of subjects to generate per class
